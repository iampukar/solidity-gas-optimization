## Short Circuiting

Short-circuiting is a strategy we can make use of when an operation makes use of either || or &&. This pattern works by ordering the lower-cost operation first so that the higher-cost operation may be skipped (short-circuited) if the first operation evaluates to true.

    // f(x) is low cost
    // g(y) is expensive

    // Ordering should go as follows
    f(x) || g(y)
    f(x) && g(y)
